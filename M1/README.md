# MNIST Digit Addition Project

This project implements and compares various machine learning models for performing digit addition using MNIST digits. The models are trained to predict the sum of two MNIST digits.

## Prerequisites

### Python Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
